        <h1 class="title-main"> Atlas INC </h1>
        <p>Atlas INC is known for developing and focusing on improving today's technological society, with foundations in the UN's sustainable development goals.
          Atlas INC is a group that started in Norway but has recently expanded to the rest of the world.
          The headquarters are located in Oslo, but we have several premises around the world.</p>
          <p> Atlas INC was founded in 1968 by Herman Hansen, and later acquired by John Koph.</p>
          <p>One of our most famous projects is interstellar travel. Atlas wants to improve the standard of living of the people on earth.
            To achieve this, we believe that interstellar travel can provide opportunities for new resources that can optimize the standard of living for all inhabitants of the earth.
            The opportunities to find resources that can e.g. give less emissions of dangerous gases, which in turn results in a more sustainable everyday life.</p>
            <p> Our main goals are as following:
	<li>Providing alternative resources to further sustainability</li>
  <li>Developing a clean energy program for the cointries with the most emissions</li>
  <li>Acquire further information about the usage of earthâ€™s resources</li>
