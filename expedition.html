        <h1 class="page-title">Expedition | How do we plan to fuel the spaceship?</h1>
        <h4><bold> 1. The nuclear option</bold></h4> <p>At this point in human history, every rocket we’ve ever launched into space has one thing in common: it’s been propelled by chemical-based fuel.
        Yes, rocket fuel is a special mix of chemical fuels designed to maximize thrust, but the “chemical fuel” part is very important:
        it states that the reactions powering it rely on the rearrangement of bonds between various atoms to provide energy. This is fundamentally limiting! For an atom, the overwhelming majority of its mass is in the atom’s nucleus: 99.95%. When you’re engaging in a chemical reaction, the electrons orbiting the atoms get rearranged, typically releasing somewhere around 0.0001% of the total mass of the atoms involved in the form of energy, via Einstein’s famous equation: E = mc². That means, for every 1 kilogram of fuel you load up your rocket with, you’ll only get the energy equivalent of somewhere in the ballpark of 1 milligram of mass out of the reaction. (Forbes, 2020)</p>
        <h4><bold> 2.) A space-based laser array </bold></h4> <p>Whereas conventional spacecraft rely on bringing their own fuel on board and expending it to self-accelerate, the key idea at play here is that a large, high-powered laser array would provide the needed thrust to an external spacecraft.
          In other words, the source of the thrust would be separate from the spacecraft itself. Laser technology is successfully becoming not only more powerful, but more highly collimated as well, which means that if we can engineer a sail-like material that could reflect a high enough percentage of that laser light, we could use that laser blast to accelerate a spacecraft to tremendous speeds away from the source of our array. A ~1 gram-mass “starchip” could conceivably reach ~20% the speed of light, which would enable it to arrive at Proxima Centauri, our nearest star, in just 22 years. (Forbes 2020)  </p>
        <h4><bold>3.) Antimatter fuel </bold></h4> <p>If we’re going to bring fuel with us, we might as well make it the most efficient fuel possible: matter-antimatter annihilations. Rather than chemical-based or even nuclear-based fuels, where only a portion of the mass brought on board gets converted to energy, a matter-antimatter annihilation would convert 100% of the mass of both matter and antimatter into energy. This is the ultimate in efficiency for fuel: the prospect of converting all of it into energy that could be used for thrust.

        <p>The <bold>difficulty</bold> comes only in practice, and in particular, on three fronts:</p>
        <li> The creation of stable, neutral antimatter</li>
        <li> The ability to isolate it away from normal matter and precisely control it</li>
        <li> To produce it in large enough quantities that it could be useful for interstellar travel</li>
